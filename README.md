## Credits

- [Tidy3D](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d): meow uses the free FDE mode solver from Tidy3D.
- [SAX](https://github.com/flaport/sax): meow uses SAX as its circuit simulator when cascading the overlap S-matrices.
- [klujax](https://github.com/flaport/sax): Although technically an optional backend for SAX, klujax will significantly speed up the final S-matrix calculation of your structures.
- [EMEPy](https://github.com/BYUCamachoLab/emepy): an excellent alternative python-based EME solver with optional neural network mode solver.
