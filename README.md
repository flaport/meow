![meow](docs/source/_static/img/meow.png)

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/meow-sim.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/meow-sim)

A simple electromagnetic [EigenMode Expansion (EME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenmode_expansion) tool for Python.

## Installation

### Minimal installation
```sh
pip install meow-sim[min]
```

### Full installation
```sh
pip install meow-sim[full]
```

### Selecting features
You can select which features to enable during installation as follows:
```sh
pip install meow-sim[feature1,feature2,...]
```

#### Available features
* `min`: minimal installation (equivalent to not specifying any features)
* `vis`: explicitly installs matplotlib and trimesh.
* `jax`: use JAX in stead of numpy to calculate the S-matrices
* `klu`: use `klujax` to speed up S-matric calculations (implies `jax`). Note: you need
the SuiteSparse headers on your computer for this to work.
* `gds`: enable GDS creation with GDSFactory (see GDS Taper example).
* `ipy`: install useful jupyter/ipython packages.
* `dev`: install dev dependencies
* `full`: enable all the above features.
